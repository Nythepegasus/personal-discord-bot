# Nikki's Personal Discord Bot
This is my own Discord bot that I have created for a personal server.
### Installation
Clone the repository into the directory you want to store the bot using:

`git clone https://github.com/nythepegasus/personal-discord-bot.git`

Run `python3 main.py` and it'll go through a first run time asking for `TOKEN`, `owner_id`, and `command_prefix`.

You can also edit the config yourself in `conf_files/conf.json`.
